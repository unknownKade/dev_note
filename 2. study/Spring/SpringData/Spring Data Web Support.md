- provides model support in MVC architectures.
- @EnableSpringDataWebSupport
- make "DomainClassConverter" bean
- OSIV(Open Session In View = OEIV)
	- Hibernate's OSIV used to extend persistence context to presentation layer
		- this made changes in the model be persisted automatically
		- to fix this they used to
			- make entity read-only
			- wrap entity
			- return only as DTO
	- In Spring's OEIV has been changed to only persist to businesslayer
		- persistence context range can be handled using @Transactional
